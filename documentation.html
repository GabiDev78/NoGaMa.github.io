              As I was responsible of the NoGaMa group for this project, I am very proud of the result. We achieved to work together and to stay focus during the whole project, which was very pleasant.
From my personal point of view, this project has taught me so many things, starting from Unity, obviously, going to the improvement of my code comprehension and the C# and Unity3d documentation. This project was really a good experience, and I thank all my teammates for their participation and involvement in it.

              Being part of this project was really an exciting and very rewarding experience. It is the first "serious" project that I did in a group, with specific expectations and individual and collective objectives. I think that I have learned a lot in the past few months working on this project and that it will surely serve me in the future. I would like to thank my colleagues who worked on the project.

                This project was very enriching from the first beginning until it's end. Personally, I have acquired a lot of skills that will certainly help me in the future. It was not the first time I programmed a videogame, but the first time I used powerful tools like Unity.

                Creating the game maps taught me the idea behind designing games. After the creation of each one I have gained more ideas on making more challenging game maps. It gave me an opportunity to be more creative and to think differently. It also taught me working with a team. I believe that we learned a lot from each other. I am happy that I got to work with this team on this project.
